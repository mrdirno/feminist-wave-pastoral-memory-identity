## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a diary entry from the perspective of Hester Gable, describing a 'recipe' that serves as a coded message for her network.
- Compose a modern-day scene where Elara teaches Mira a fundamental, physical lesson of the farm (like splitting wood or birthing a lamb), forcing a shift in their dynamic.
- Imagine a chapter from the perspective of the farm itself, personified, observing the generations of Gable women and their struggles.
- Create a 'found document'—a seed catalog, a quilt pattern, a weather-worn note—that contains a hidden layer of meaning about the women's lives.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Digital Steamer Trunk' interface that presents nested, layered documents (ledger scans, audio of Elara's thoughts, photos of artifacts) to explore the non-linear nature of memory.
- Design a 'Rhizome Map' visualization tool that connects characters, themes, and objects from the novel (e.g., linking Boudicca the hen to the concept of 'feminine economy' to a specific ledger entry).
