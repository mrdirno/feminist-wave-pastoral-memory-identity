  "cover_prompt": "A woman's weathered hands gently cradle a worn, open ledger resting on rich soil, its pages filled with handwritten entries and pressed botanical specimens that seem to grow from the paper itself, set within the golden light of a vast, rolling farm at dusk where the furrows in the earth mirror the lines on her palms and spectral, translucent impressions of women from different eras—planting, writing, and observing—overlay the landscape like memories made visible. This scene of quiet archaeological discovery is rendered in the atmospheric style of Anna Ancher and Andrew Wyeth, combining intimate domestic realism with a haunting, luminous pastoralism, where every brushstroke feels like a recovered fragment of history. The composition is a dramatic, centered book cover frame with a low-angle perspective that empowers the subject, emphasizing the connection between hand, book, and land. The lighting is a nostalgic, cinematic golden hour glow with deep, earthy shadows, using a color palette of burnt umber, dusty rose, sepia, sage green, and old paper cream, punctuated by the vibrant green of living plants. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
